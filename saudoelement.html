<p>Web development is a constantly evolving field. Staying updated with the latest technologies is crucial for success.</p>

<p>Front-end developers focus on creating user-friendly interfaces. They often use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

<p>Back-end development handles data and server-side logic. It ensures everything behind the scenes works smoothly.</p>

<p>Full-stack developers work on both the front-end and back-end. They bridge the gap between design and data management.</p>
